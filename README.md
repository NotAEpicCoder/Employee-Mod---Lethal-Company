Note: Everyone in the server HAS to have it installed in order to work properly.

Welcome! This is the official "The dubiously goofy thiveing employees" discord modpack.

Updates will happen making this better and fun. Issues? Contact @BojanglesTheJangle


INSTALLATION: Install the unzipped version of Bepinex in the Lethal Company folder where the .exe is at..
Dont know where the exe is? Just go to your Steam Library, right click it or click the cogwheel, select manage and browse local files, and your there!

UNINSTALLATION AND REINSTALLATION: Want to keep the mods but want to turn them on at a later time? Just go into the games files and rename the Bepinex folder to whatever you want, then change it back when your ready to have fun!
